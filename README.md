# AURIGAanalysis

This code extracts and analyzes data from the AURIGA Simulation, performing tasks such as reading snapshot data for specific particle types, loading subhalo catalogs, centering on the main galaxy and selecting relevant particles, converting stellar formation times to lookback times, and navigating the merger tree to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of subhalos.
